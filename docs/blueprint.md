- Accent color: Soft lavender (#D0BCFF) to highlight key elements and add a touch of creativity.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean, modern, and highly readable appearance.
- Use a consistent set of line icons from a library like Font Awesome or Feather Icons, in the accent color.

- Use subtle animations for transitions and interactions, such as a smooth scroll or a gentle fade-in effect. Animation should be tasteful and not distracting.
